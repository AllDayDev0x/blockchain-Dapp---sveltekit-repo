## Let's test the smart contract

Tests are important, as always but it may be more important when you are developing an smart contract. Why?
Because the blockchain is immutable.

The main difference between Solidity development and other languages or environment is that after the implementation of an smart contract in the Ethereum network the contract is immutable, meaning that it will never be modified or updated again.

The first code that get's deployed is the one that will remains unchanged for the rest of time. This is because one the main concerns of Solidity is security. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there is no way to patch it later. You would have to tell to the users of the contract to use a different contract (identified by an `address`) to get the fix.

Sounds uncomfortable right? But, believe it or not, this is a **feature**. The code that your wrote it becomes a **law**. IF you read the code of an smart contract (and verified that that code is actually the one deployed) you can be sure that every time you call a function it will behave exactly as the code says it.

So you need to be sure before deploy and the best way to get that confidence is by testing.

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (the development environment of choice for this course) offers the tools to test the smart contract using Javascript or Typescript by leveraging the power of [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) to interact with the Ethereum network and [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/), a testing library built on top of Ethere.js

You already dip your toes on a bit of testing code, now let's add a more robust test to check that the contract behaves as expected.

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai'); // Require the assertion library
const { providers } = require('ethers');
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');

describe('TipJar', function () {
	//describe the main test
	let contract;
	this.beforeAll(async () => {
		// Deploy the contract once for every test case
		const contractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('TipJar'); //Create an abstraction of the contract used to deploy the TipJar
		contract = await contractFactory.deploy(); // Start the deployment process, resolves to a Contract object
		await contract.deployed();
	});
	it('Should deploy the contract and return 0 as totalTips', async function () {
		expect(await contract.getTotalTips()).to.equal(0); // Retrieve the total number of tips
	});

	it('Should allow to send a tip and increase the number of total tips', async function () {
		const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners(); // Get two addresses, the owner and the sender
		const balance = await owner.getBalance(); // Get the account balance of the owner
		const senderBalance = await sender.getBalance();
		/*
		 * perform the send transaction
		 * You pass the message and the name as arguments and the value as an object that is then
		 * used as the global `msg` object in the contract
		 * to define the amount of ETH use the parseEther utility
		 */
		const tx = await contract
			.connect(sender)
			.sendTip('message', 'name', { value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001') });
		await tx.wait();

		const newBalance = await owner.getBalance(); // Get the new balance of the owner account
		const newSenderBalance = await sender.getBalance();

		expect(newBalance).to.be.above(balance); // Check that the new balance if greater than before
		expect(newSenderBalance).to.be.below(senderBalance);
		expect(await contract.getTotalTips()).to.equal(1); // Get the total number of tips
	});

	it('should return all the tips', async function () {
		const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.002');

		const [, sender] = await ethers.getSigners(); // Get two addresses, the owner and the sender
		// Perform another transaction
		const tx = await contract.connect(sender).sendTip('2nd message', '2nd name', { value: amount });
		await tx.wait();
		const tips = await contract.getAllTips();
		// Since this test ran in the same contract instance as before the total number of tips should be 2
		expect(await contract.getTotalTips()).to.equal(2);
		// The lenght of the tips arrray should be 2 too
		expect(tips.length).to.equal(2);
		// The second element of the tips array should be the same as the transaction sent
		expect(tips[1].message).to.equal('2nd message');
		// The amount of the second element of the tips array should be the same as the transaction sent
		expect(tips[1].amount).to.be.equal(amount);
	});

	it('should fail to send eth bigger than the balance', async function () {
		const [, sender] = await ethers.getSigners(); // Get two addresses, the owner and the sender
		const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther('9999');
		// Perform another transaction
		const tx = contract.connect(sender).sendTip('event message', 'name', { value: amount });
		// Check that the transaction was reverted.
		await expect(tx).to.be.reverted;
	});
});
```

With this in place (file `test/TipJar.js`) you are ready to run the tests.

Run in the terminal

```bash
$ npm run hardhat:test
```

and see the results. Now you have confidence that the smart contract works as expeected. Is time to deploy this to a local network and work in the client application.
