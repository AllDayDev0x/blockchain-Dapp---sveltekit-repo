## üöå Getting starting with Ethereum Development

- [Demo app can be found here](https://getting-started-fullstack-ethereum-development.vercel.app/)
- [Course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/full-stack-web3-and-blockchain-development-on-ethereum-with-sveltekit-f522ceec??af=4cexzz)
 
In this course you'll learn about the many moving parts required to start building a full stack (descentralized) application based on the Ethereum network. How to write an smart contract, write tests and how to interact with it through a web application.

Lastly, you'll learn how to deploy your dapp to the blockchain.

> **Important** 
> SvelteKit is still in beta. Expect bugs! Read more here, and track progress towards 1.0 here.
> This course was recorded pointing to the version 1.0.0-next.437 of Svelte kit 
> It will be updated after sveltekit reach version 1.0.0 


This will:

- spawn a local ethereum network
- compile and locally deploy the smart contract
- Run the contract tests
- run the web application and open your browser

> Now you just need to import an account into metamask to test the application locally
> This will be shown through the course

### ‚ùì How to run each lesson

Each video lesson have a companion code that you'll be able to find in a corresponding branch named as `lesson-XX`.
